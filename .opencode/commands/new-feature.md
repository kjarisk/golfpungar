description: Scaffold a new feature slice
subtask: true
---

Load the `add-feature` skill and use it to scaffold a new feature slice.

The feature name is: $ARGUMENTS

Before scaffolding:

1. Read `docs/outline.md` and confirm the feature is listed there.
2. If it is NOT listed, STOP and tell the user: "This feature is not in docs/outline.md. Add it first."
3. If it IS listed, proceed with the skill instructions.

After scaffolding, suggest the next implementation step based on `docs/plan.md`.
