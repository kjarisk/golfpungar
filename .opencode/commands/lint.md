description: Run linting and auto-fix issues

Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix lint issues, then run `npm run lint` to check for remaining errors.

If there are remaining errors:

1. List each error with file path and line number.
2. Fix them one at a time.
3. Run `npm run lint` again to confirm all errors are resolved.

Do NOT skip or suppress lint errors with eslint-disable comments unless there is a documented reason.
