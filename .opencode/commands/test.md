description: Run tests with coverage report
---

Run `npm run test:coverage` to execute the full test suite with coverage.

After the tests complete:

1. Report the pass/fail summary.
2. If any tests failed, show the failure details and suggest fixes.
3. Report the coverage summary (statements, branches, functions, lines).
4. If coverage dropped below 80% on any metric, flag it and suggest which files need more tests.

Do NOT modify tests to make them pass unless the test itself is wrong. Fix the source code instead.
